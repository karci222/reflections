What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It will create a directory, where are saved metadata, that are crucial to reload previous versions, show commits, and generally manage all
the things with gits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging is part of process, where you will store files, that should be tracked by git, and repository stores these files. It`s good when
you need to add some files, but you are not sure which files you want to add, and if you don`t want to add them in that directory, you
can always change that.
