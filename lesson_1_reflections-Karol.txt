How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If I will create a long program, or application, maybe I will want to make some changes, but what if later, I will find out, that an old version is wrong? Well I can always return to that version, instead of spending hours, maybe weeks on reparing an old error.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: -you have a total control of what you are saving
      -you can choose wether you should save or not save actual version
      -you can write whatever you need to commit

Cons: 	-you can forget to make a commit
	-you can commit something wrongly
