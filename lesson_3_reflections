When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do that if I`m not on my own computer, or I would like to do something, that is public, 
and I would like to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe I would like to do some experimental changes, that could break final product, so I would rather make those changes safe and
therefore, I would make them only local, and when everything`s alright, I can just add it to repository, and if it isn`t, I`ll just
reload everything from online repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are stored on GitHub, and not on local machine. They are useful, when I don`t want to paste them to my local computer, but
I still want acces to them.
Clones are copies from GitHub repositories into local computer. They are useful when I want to add something from GitHub to my local
computer.
Branches are present on local machine, and they are like parts of the tree of my program. They are useful when adding some extra
features, that are just in test phase.
